# JavaScript-AI-Example
This is a JavaScript AI I made in three days for my science teacher to show him how **neural networks** work in **word situations**.
Runs with two linked neural networks in a flappy bird like simulator where they can choose to add up velocity or not.
If the blocks (birds) touch the top or bottom of there iframe, they are deleted and replaced by a slightly changed copy of there partner.
